# Checkers
Java program to play checkers. The program uses Scanner to take the current position and new position from each player. The current player will have to input the row number, a space and then the capital letter of the column according to checkers board below. For example, if the player inputs 3 A (current position) and 4 B (new position), the program will move the black piece accordingly.

The program has validating methods for each piece and it keeps track of how many pieces each player has left in order to determine a winner.

Although the program is functional, I am still yet to add the below features to it:
- make the program recognise when a piece becomes king, as well as add validating methods for its moves
- validate if more than one attack is possible
- add try catch to appropriately deal with exceptions
- learn frontend to add a UI to the game

In order for the board to be properly aligned, please ensure you are using a monospaced font that supports unicode characters, such as NSimSun, MS Gothic and SimSun.
